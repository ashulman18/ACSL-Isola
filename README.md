# ACSL-Isola

ACSL Isola is a board game played by 2 players with each player having just one marker. 
The game has 49 grid squares as shown above. The 49 grid squares have removable numbered tiles. 
The players move in turn and can move horizontally in either direction, vertically in either direction 
and diagonally in every direction. The marker can move in the selected direction until it is adjacent to 
the opposing marker or reaches the boundary of the board. After the move, the player removes all the tiles 
in the path moved. Once a tile is removed it too becomes a boundary and cannot be landed on or passed over. 
The object of the game is to be the last player to be able to make a move.
